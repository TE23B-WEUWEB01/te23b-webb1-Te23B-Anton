                <p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft took this image of Earth's Moon on Dec. 7, 1992, on its way to explore the
                    Jupiter system in 1995-97. The distinct bright ray crater at the bottom of the image is the Tycho
                    impact
                    basin.</p>

                <h3>2017 Total Solar Eclipse</h3>
                <p>During the total solar eclipse, the Sun’s corona, only visible during the total eclipse, is shown as
                    a
                    crown of white flares from the surface. The red spots called Bailey's beads occurs where the moon
                    grazes
                    by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some
                    areas

                <p>AS11-40-5878 (20 July 1969) --- A close-up view of an astronaut's bootprint in the lunar soil,
                    photographed with a 70mm lunar surface camera during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on
                    the
                    moon. While astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, commander, and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot,
                    descended in the Lunar Module (LM) "Eagle" to explore the Sea of Tranquility region of the moon,
                    astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM)
                    "Columbia" in lunar orbit.</p>
